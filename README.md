# Who I am
 I am the SDCT at the DM1 DataCenter. Most people around the DC just refer to me by my last name, which is fine

## What I do
1. Be the go to for my team for weird or new stuff
2. Be the point of contact when additional help is needed for the DCTs.
3. Make sure that our special projects follow our **process** rather than just following *"The Plan"*
## Why I am on GitHub
This is my first experience with GitHub, outside of the occasional program download. I now learning how to use GitHub in the course of learning how to make software. 
## What I enjoy outside of work
When I am not working, I tend to try and spend time with my wife and my menagerie of animals, 3 dogs and...... *several* cats. All of them are what give me my drive and bring immense joy to my life. I may or may not enjoy the ocassional video game as well.
## My working experiences
I have held many different types of job roles in my working life. The job I have now is certainly the one I have enjoyed the most thus far and the fact that I have managed to learn as much as I have about the wide variety of equpiment we work with has definitly benefitted me.
