## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
###### General Kenobi!
# Who I am
 I am the SDCT at the DM1 DataCenter. Most people around the DC just refer to me by my last name, which is fine

## What I do
1. Be the go to for my team for weird or new stuff
2. Be the point of contact when additional help is needed for the DCTs.
3. Make sure that our special projects follow our **process** rather than just following *"The Plan"*
## Find Me
You can also find me on LinkedIn [Here](www.linkedin.com/in/eric-woodley-63b5bb1a6)
## My Critters
I have several animals in my house but one tends to demand most of my attention when she can get it and that is my Furball, Gizmo ![Furball](https://github.com/Ewoodley/Ewoodley/blob/cd6ff8363bf60632811043f124a642ba7166aee7/20210727_045808.jpg)
